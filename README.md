# Distributed-Systems

I'm very interested in learning about Distributed Systems, and have been working through the book *Distributed Systems* by *Nancy A. Lynch*.
Here, I have tried to implement a number of the models and algorithms discussed in that book. This includes things like models of synchronous an asynchronous networks, and solutions to the leader election problem.
All the code is written in Java, and organised by model type and problem.
Each modle/problem has some breif associated documentation.
